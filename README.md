# Portfolio


This is my personal website https://pierre.codes

Made using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and bundled using [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/)

To test it locally, clone the repository then just run the following commands: 

```
npm i
npm start
```
Afterwards, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
